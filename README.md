## Architecture

### SwiftUI + MVVM Pattern
- **Views**: SwiftUI-based user interface components
- **ViewModels**: ObservableObject classes managing state and business logic
- **Models**: Codable structs for API data representation

### Key Components

#### `ContentView.swift`
- Main interface with search functionality
- Responsive layout handling for different screen sizes
- Share functionality implementation

#### `CharacterViewModel.swift`
- Core business logic and data management
- Network request handling with Combine framework
- Caching and recent searches management
- Error handling and validation

#### `CharacterInfo.swift`
- Complete data model structures for API responses
- Nested structs for organized data representation

#### `OrientationManager.swift`
- Device orientation management utilities

### Caching Strategy
- **NSCache**: Memory-based caching with size limits
- **UserDefaults**: Persistent storage for recent searches
- **Timeout Management**: 1-minute cache validity
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup and size limits
